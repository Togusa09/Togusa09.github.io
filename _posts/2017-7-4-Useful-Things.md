=Tools=
==OneNote==
Allows saving notes and sharing them between different platforms. It has mobile, windows and web apps and is accessible through onedrive. It also supports drawing on mobile devices, tables and touch screens.

==Zendesk==
Provides a single place to handle customer communication through. It allows threads of communication with clients to be managed through a single interface, allowing people to be added or removed from the discussion at any time. Private notes can be used for distributing messages to other members of the team without the client seeing them. This is for keeping technical or background discussion noise away from the client. If you're sending emails straight to a customer, you're probably doing it wrong.

==Support Contract Management==
Also known as "Blobfish" for an unknown reason. This is an internal Readify product that allows tracking of the contract time used for each client as the month goes on. Watching this is important if you have a client that has less than 20 hours, or often goes over hours so you can avoid overage. UI Can be configured to only show relevant clients

Is there a user guide for this anywhere?

==LinqPad==
Scratchpad for c#. Describe scenarios of use. Is useful for setting up test scenarios in environments on a scale larger than integration tests.

==Google Chrome==
While choice of browsers is always a topic of debate, Google Chrome has multiprofile support simplifies managing different login sessions that would normally conflict (ie. Logging in multiple Microsoft accounts). These sessions can be saved and reactivated when the profile is resumed, so you don't have to re-enter the credentials if the login hasn't expired. 

==RediUpdates==
Readify portal for compiling and distributing weekly summaries. It provides tracking of what was done that week, what will be done next week, any upcoming opportunities and ongoing issues. There is currently no "Save" button on the site, but hitting "next" or "back" will save what you have entered.

=Practices=
	- Keeping notes through day
	- Record time in tenrox at end of day, or when switching customer
	- Update Rediupdates at end of day. There is always a chance you won't be on the customer
	- Send to client list of items planned to complete
	- Send to client a summary of tasks completed at the end of the day
Whenever you do something, think "Who would be interested to know this", regardless of the scale of activity. Even if the answer is usually only yourself, it's important to be mindful of it. This would work great with a client stakeholder map.
