title: Intro to Apple AR-Kit

Special thanks to Tod for chasing an iPhone 6 for me, and apologies to him for telling him I needed an iPhone 6 when I needed a 6S.

Requirements for developing Apple AR-Kit
* iOS device with an A9 or A10 processor and iOS 11 Beta. This includes the iPhone 6S (emphasis on S), iPhone 7, iPad Pro or iPad (2017).
* Mac OS computer running Mac OS version 10.12.4 or above

Include note on signing profile setup just in case

To begin, I wanted to see how easy it was to get started with running a bare minimum sample AR-Kit app. Fortunately the default template includes a bare bones example that contains a pre-populated model to show off the positional tracking capabilities. 

Document steps for creating new app

After deploying to the iPad, I could run the demo:

Add video

The tracking is surprisingly stable given the much fewer sensors compared to the Hololens. The model does jump around a little when there are obstructions or rapid movement.


Section showing off hit tracking. Not perfect, but quite good considering.

Add intermediate section on plane detection

Unity build process is similar to the one of the hololens, run a build in unity, which exports to a folder, then open in xcode and run on device.
